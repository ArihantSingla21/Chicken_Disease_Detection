# Chicken Disease Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning system for classifying chicken diseases from images. It provides a robust framework for identifying various chicken diseases, helping in early detection and treatment.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**: GitHub Actions or Jenkins
- **Cloud Services**: AWS and Azure for deployment
- **Data Version Control**: DVC for managing datasets and model versions

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip

## Features
- Image classification for chicken diseases
- Utility functions for:
  - YAML configuration management
  - JSON data handling
  - Binary file operations
  - Image encoding/decoding in base64

  - File size tracking

## Usage
The project includes various utility functions that can be imported from the package:

```python
from chicken_disease_classification.utils.common import (
    read_yaml,
    create_directories,
    save_json,
    load_json,
    save_bin,
    load_bin,
    get_size,
    encodeImageIntoBase64,
    decodeImage
)
```
