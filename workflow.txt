## the process we need to follow 
1. Update the config.yaml file 
2. Update the params.yaml file 
3. Update the entity
4. Update the configuration manager in src config
5. Update the components
6. Update the common utility functions in `src/chicken_disease_classification/utils/common.py` to enhance functionality and maintainability.
7. Update the pipeline scripts in `src/chicken_disease_classification/pipeline/` to ensure they align with the new configurations and improve data flow.
8. Update the main entry point in `src/chicken_disease_classification/main.py` to integrate the latest features and ensure proper execution of the pipeline.
9. Update the DVC configuration files in the root directory to track new datasets and models, ensuring version control and reproducibility.
10. Review and refactor the logging mechanisms in `src/chicken_disease_classification/utils/common.py` for better clarity and consistency.
11. Ensure that all components in the pipeline are modular and can be easily tested and maintained.
